54560=A query element was a collection geometry or a multitype geometry. Such geometries are not permitted in a query element because they are at the top of the geometry hierarchy. A query element must be part of the source geometry.@Redefine the query element or the source geometry so that a label can be output.

54605=Transient tables/views from a previous CREATE_PC operation were still in existence.@Delete the invalid Point Cloud from the base table (for cleanup of scratch tables), and initialize and create the Point Cloud again. Alternately, use SDO_UTIL.DROP_WORK_TABLES with oidstring as the parameter.
54607=An internal read error occurred during Point Cloud creation.@Contact Oracle Support Services with the error number reported.
54608=An internal LOB write error occurred during Point Cloud creation. The cause might be lack of table space.@Look for information from other errors in the stack, or contact Oracle Support Services with the error number reported.
54609=The extent of the Point Cloud was null.@Specify an extent for the Point Cloud that is not null.
54610=The extent of the Point Cloud was more than 2-D for geodetic data.@Change the extent to 2-D (longitude, latitude).
54611=The base table or schema, or both, were invalid strings, or the base table and schema combination did not exist.@Ensure that the specified base table exists in the specified schema before performing the initialization operation.
54613=The necessary privileges to create the trigger were not granted.@Grant the necessary privileges to create the trigger. If necessary, contact Oracle Support Services for help with privileges for trigger creation.
54614=The specified block table name was not unique. For example, it might have been used for another block table.@Specify a different block table name.
54616=An internal error occurred.@Contact Oracle Support Services.
54617=The input Point Cloud for the CLIP_PC operation was invalid.@Specify a point cloud that was created using the CREATE_PC procedure.
54618=The Point Cloud and the query geometry had incompatible SRID values.@Change the query SRID to be compatible with that of the Point Cloud.

54643=An invalid string was specified for the WORKTABLESPACE parameter.@Specify an existing valid tablespace for WORKTABLESPACE (to hold the scratch tables).
54644=The names for the input/output tables were invalid, or the tables did not exist or did not have the right structure.@Check the Spatial documentation for PARTITION_TABLE.
54651=An invalid or unknown parameter was specified in the creation of the TIN.@Check the Spatial documentation for CREATE_TIN.
54652=The specified table for loading points into a TIN did not exist.@Create the points table with appropriate columns, and then create the TIN.
